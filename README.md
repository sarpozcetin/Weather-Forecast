### Why I built this
This was my first project that I started after graduating University. Ive been working on it on and off changing the design and direction of the project multiple times. I eventually settled on focusing purely on frontend rather than frontend + backend to simplify things. My main goal for this project was to expose myself to JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and integrating APIs to obtain real data.
